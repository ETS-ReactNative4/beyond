# Application Languages

The language settings allow you to set the values supported by the application and the default value.

The default value is used in case the device language is not in the list of the supported languages by the application.

To configure a language other than the one set by the device, use the beyond.languages.current property. If the value of
the .current property is modified, it is automatically saved in localStorage to be used again when the application is
reloaded.
